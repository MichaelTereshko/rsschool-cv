# About Me
I worked as an engineer for non-destructive testing of metal and welding for over ten years. Now I decided to change my professional activity and become a front-end developer. In December 2021, I started studying at RS School.
In the future, I would like to create useful and user-friendly applications and websites. I enjoy working in a team. I am interested in science. Especially non-destructive testing of metal. And I have some good ideas that will make the work of engineers in this area easier and more convenient.
## Personal qualities:
*Conscientious, motivated, quality-oriented, creative, hardworking.*
